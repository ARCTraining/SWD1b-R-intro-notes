# 5_Vectorisation.R
#
# Most of Râ€™s functions are vectorized, meaning that the function will operate
# on all elements of a vector without needing to loop through and act on each 
# element one at a time. This makes writing code more concise, easy to read, and
# less error prone.
x <- 1:4
x * 2
# The multiplication happened to each element of the vector. The vectors could 
# also be added together:
y <- 6:9
x + y
# Each element of x was added to its corresponding element of y:
# Here is how we would add two vectors together using a for loop:
output_vector <- c()
for (i in 1:4) {
  output_vector[i] <- x[i] + y[i]
}
output_vector
# Compare this to the output using vectorised operations.
sum_xy <- x + y
sum_xy

# Comparison operators, logical operators, and many functions are also
# vectorized:
# Comparison operators
x > 2
# Logical operators
a <- x > 3  # or, for clarity, a <- (x > 3)
a
# Most functions also operate element-wise on vectors:
x <- 1:4
log(x)
# Vectorized operations work element-wise on matrices:
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)
m * -1
